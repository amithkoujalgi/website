# Distributed Systems and Observability

This project is centered around the simulation of a stock market environment through the utilization of distributed
systems and a message broker for seamless communication among dierent components of the system. In this simulation,
producers generate synthetic stock price data as well as buy and sell orders, while consumers execute these orders and
ensure the system stays up-to-date.
The system offers APIs that allow traders to list their orders, review their portfolio, and create new orders for buying
or selling. Additionally, it provides APIs for accessing information on available stock instruments, including their
last traded price and more.
As part of its design, the system incorporates observability features, enabling the tracking of various aspects within
the system. This enhances transparency and facilitates in-depth analysis of its functioning.
