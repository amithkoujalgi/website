Hello LLM Enthusiasts!

I wanted to share a project I've been working on – a bot that takes document interaction to the next level! 🤖💼

📂 What does it do?

This bot is designed to accept PDF documents and allows you to ask questions directly on them. 🚀 Imagine a seamless experience where you can engage with your documents in a conversational manner! 🗂️💬

🔍 How does it work?

Powered by advanced Language Models (LLMs), the bot brings a new dimension to document understanding. 🌐🧠 Thanks to the magic of Ollama, the LLMs are downloaded and served dynamically, ensuring the latest and greatest capabilities for document analysis! 🚀🔗

🌐 Why is this special?

- Interactive PDFs: Say goodbye to static documents! 📄✨ Interact with your PDFs like never before.
- Conversational Interface: Ask questions, seek information, and get intelligent responses in a conversational format.
- Dynamic LLMs: Always up-to-date with the latest language models, thanks to Ollama's seamless integration.
🙌 How to Experience it:
Simply upload your PDF documents, and start a conversation! The bot is ready to assist you in unlocking the full potential of your documents. 💡🚀
