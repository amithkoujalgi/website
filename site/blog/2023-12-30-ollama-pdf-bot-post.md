Hello LLM Enthusiasts!

I wanted to share the details about a project that I put together while exploring LLMs and trying
out some ideas.

#### What is it?

Imagine an experience where you can engage with your text documents ðŸ“„ in a conversational ðŸ’¬ manner!
This is exactly what it is. **A PDF Bot** ðŸ¤–. It is a chatbot that accepts PDF documents and lets you have conversation
over it.

#### How is this helpful?

- **_Talk to your documents_**: Interact with your PDFs and extract the information in a way that you'd like ðŸ“„âœ¨. This could
  prove helpful in summarising the PDF, or to fetch
  specific details from a long document or to list/format data in a structure you'd like and much more!
- **_Choose your LLM_**: Switch to a different model that works for your needs. You control the system according to your
  requirements.
- **_Local Setup_**: The LLMs and the chat app is setup locally. Your data does not leave your computer!

#### How does it work?

The system consists of an app, LLM and a question-answering module.
The app is the interface for the user - where the user can upload PDF document and then ask questions. (built
with [StreamLit](https://streamlit.io/)).
The app connects to a module (built with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)) that loads the PDF, extracts text,
splits it into smaller chunks, generates embeddings from
the text using LLM served via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) (a tool to manage and run LLMs locally) and creates a
vectorstore for information
retrieval.
It then sets up a question-answering system that enables user to have a conversation with the system.
